# <em>TeaDrinkingHelper</em>
a simple pygame with alarm function to keep you hydrated everyday!<br />
pure python3 project!



# Goal
Fancy cute little liteweight GUI that display current time and remind user to drink water based on set time!<br />
Click-disappear player w/ sound that always shows on the very top of the screen!<br />
Possible HTML link that links to milktea-delivery would be AWESOME!<br />

# What's under developing
1. a GUI
2. background running mechanism

# What's done
1. a gif player! but seems not compatable with every gif file..need fixing
2. a timer! ...that trys to mimic the function of a SIMPLE clock.. still has some performance issue (cost too much CPU)

# Check current progress
run 'python main.py' under root folder
