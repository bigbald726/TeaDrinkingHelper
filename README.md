# <em>TeaDrinkingHelper</em>
A simple pygame with alarm function to keep you hydrated every day! <br />
Pure python3 alert!



# Goal
1. Fancy cute little lightweight GUI that display current time and remind user to drink water based on set time!<br />
2. Click-disappear player w/ sound that always shows on the very top of the screen!<br />
3. Possible HTML link that links to MilkTea-delivery websites/apps would be AWESOME!<br />

# What's under developing
1. fixing button click malfunction
2. adding function to cancel the running alarm

# What's done
1. a gif player! but seems not compatable with every gif file..need fixing
2. a timer! ...that trys to mimic the function of a SIMPLE clock.. still has some performance issue (cost too much CPU)
3. The GUI framework is done, row/column configure in tkinter sucks! need some visual improvements afterwards

# Check current progress
run 'python UserInterface.py' under root folder
